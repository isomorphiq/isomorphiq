  "title": "Implement Drag-and-Drop Widget Rearrangement with Visual Feedback", 
  "description": "Implement complete drag-and-drop functionality for dashboard widgets including ghost previews, drop zone indicators, smooth animations, and collision detection. This requires creating drag event handlers, visual feedback components, and updating the widget placement system to support real-time position updates. Acceptance criteria: Users can drag widgets with visual ghost preview, drop zones highlight when dragging over valid areas, widgets animate smoothly to new positions, layout updates persist immediately on drop, drag-and-drop works on both desktop and touch devices, collision detection prevents widget overlap.",
