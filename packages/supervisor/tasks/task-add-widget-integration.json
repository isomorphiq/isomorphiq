This involves integrating the widget library UI with the existing dashboard state management and ensuring widgets are placed without overlap. Acceptance criteria: Clicking 'Add Widget' successfully adds widget to dashboard layout, new widgets are placed in optimal positions without overlap, dashboard state updates immediately and persists to storage, widget additions trigger layout recalculation if needed, adding widgets works across different screen sizes and responsive states, proper error handling for duplicate widgets or layout conflicts.",
