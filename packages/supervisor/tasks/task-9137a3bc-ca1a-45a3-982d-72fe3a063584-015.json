  "description": "Integrate the existing dashboard storage system with the new UI components to ensure widget positions and configurations persist across browser sessions. This task connects the frontend UI components to the existing dashboard-service.ts and dashboard-storage.ts persistence layer.\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n1. Widget position changes from drag-and-drop automatically persist to storage\n2. Widget additions/removals trigger immediate storage updates\n3. Widget resize operations persist size changes to storage\n4. Layout restoration works correctly after browser refresh/reload\n5. Error handling for storage failures with user feedback\n6. Performance optimization to debounce rapid storage operations\n7. Integration with existing dashboard-storage.ts JSON file storage\n8. Cross-tab synchronization when dashboard is open in multiple windows"
