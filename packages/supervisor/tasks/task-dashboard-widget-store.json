  "title": "Implement Widget State Management and Dashboard Store",
  "description": "Create a centralized state management system for dashboard widgets using functional programming patterns. The store should handle widget addition, removal, repositioning, and size changes without mutations. Use @tsimpl structs for type safety and implement proper event handling for state updates. Acceptance criteria: Widget store manages CRUD operations without state mutation, provides reactive updates for UI changes, implements proper TypeScript types with @tsimpl, handles widget configuration persistence, supports undo/redo for layout changes, includes proper error handling and validation.",
