  "title": "Build Responsive Grid Layout System with Mobile/Desktop Breakpoints",
  "description": "Extend the existing layout computation system to support responsive behavior across mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), and desktop (1024px+) viewports. This builds on the existing computeNextPlacement function and dashboard-layout.ts to implement CSS Grid with breakpoints, responsive widget sizing algorithms, and layout recalculation on window resize. Acceptance criteria: Dashboard layouts adapt seamlessly between breakpoints, widgets reflow appropriately for each viewport size, layout persistence works across different screen sizes, responsive behavior passes visual regression tests, touch interactions optimized for mobile devices.",
